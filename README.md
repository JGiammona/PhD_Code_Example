# PhD_Code_Example

**Example code** shows an example of the code used to examine the robustness of the early _C._ _elegans_ embryo to noise in division timing, division angles and offsets on when different cells divide

C_elegans_simulator.cc is the main simulator code.
update.cc contains the definitions of many of the simulator fucntions
simdefs.cc contains some miscellaneous function definitions
printfuncs.cc contains printing function definitions

Run "make" in this directory to compile code. 

Run "./C_elegans_simulator" to run.

Running "render timeseries.nb" with the Import functions adjusted to your machines directory path with show a rendering of your simulation in **C_elegans_test**
