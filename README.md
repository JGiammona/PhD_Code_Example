# PhD_Code_Example

**Example code** shows an example of the code used to examine the robustness of the early _C._ _elegans_ embryo to noise in division timing, division angles and offsets on when different cells divide

Run "make" in this directory to compile code. 

Run "./C_elegans_simulator" to run.

Running "render timeseries.nb" with the Import functions adjusted to your machines directory path with show a rendering of your simulation in **C_elegans_test**
